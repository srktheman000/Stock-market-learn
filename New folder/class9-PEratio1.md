## Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio

### What is P/E Ratio?

The **Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio** is a fundamental valuation metric used to determine if a stock is expensive or cheap relative to its earnings.

**Formula:**

```
P/E Ratio = Share Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS)
```

### Key Concept

- **Higher P/E** = Share is more expensive (investors are paying more for each rupee/dollar of earnings)
- **Lower P/E** = Share is cheaper (better value for money)

## Earnings Per Share (EPS)

### What is EPS?

**Earnings Per Share (EPS)** represents the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock.

**Formula:**

```
EPS = Total Profit / Total Number of Outstanding Shares
```

### Example Calculation

**Scenario:**

- Company Profit: ₹50,000
- Total Outstanding Shares: 1,000

```
EPS = 50,000 / 1,000 = ₹50 per share
```

### Important Relationship

**Profit is directly proportional to EPS**

- If profit increases → EPS increases
- If profit decreases → EPS decreases
- If number of shares increases (dilution) → EPS decreases

## P/E Ratio Rules and Guidelines

### Complete Example

**Initial Scenario:**

- Share Price: ₹600
- EPS: ₹60

```
P/E Ratio = 600 / 60 = 10
```

**If Share Price Increases:**

- New Share Price: ₹800
- EPS: ₹60 (unchanged)

```
New P/E Ratio = 800 / 60 = 13.33
```

**Result:** P/E increases (stock becomes more expensive)

### The Two Rules of P/E Movement

#### Rule 1: Share Price Impact

**When Share Price Increases → P/E Increases**

- Stock becomes more expensive relative to earnings
- Investors are paying more for the same earnings

**When Share Price Decreases → P/E Decreases**

- Stock becomes cheaper relative to earnings
- Better value proposition

#### Rule 2: EPS Impact

**When EPS Decreases → P/E Increases**

- Company earnings decline
- Stock becomes less attractive at same price
- Each share represents lower earnings

**When EPS Increases → P/E Decreases**

- Company earnings improve
- Stock becomes more attractive at same price
- Each share represents higher earnings

### General Buying Guidelines

**Optimal P/E Range for Buying:**

- Ideal P/E: **15-25**
- Maximum acceptable: Up to 25

**Important:** Always compare with:

- Industry average P/E
- Historical average P/E of the company
- Market average P/E

### Average P/E Analysis

To check if a stock is expensive:

1. Calculate the **10-year average P/E** of the stock
2. Compare current P/E with this average
3. If current P/E is significantly higher → Stock may be overvalued
4. If current P/E is lower than average → Stock may be undervalued

## PEG Ratio

### What is PEG Ratio?

**PEG (Price/Earnings to Growth) Ratio** is used when you cannot find a stock with a low P/E ratio. It factors in the company's earnings growth rate.

**Formula:**

```
PEG Ratio = P/E Ratio / Profit Growth Rate (%)
```

### When to Use PEG Ratio

Use PEG when:

1. Unable to find stocks with low P/E
2. Stock's P/E is greater than 10-year average
3. Need to evaluate growth stocks fairly

### How to Calculate PEG

**Step 1:** Check the last 3 years of profit growth
**Step 2:** Calculate average annual growth rate
**Step 3:** Divide P/E by this growth rate

### Example Calculation

**Scenario:**

- Current P/E: 30
- Last 3 Years Profit Growth: 20%, 25%, 30%
- Average Growth Rate: 25%

```
PEG Ratio = 30 / 25 = 1.2
```

### PEG Ratio Guidelines

#### For Average Market Conditions:

- **Ideal PEG:** Up to **1.5**
- PEG < 1: Undervalued
- PEG = 1: Fairly valued
- PEG > 1.5: Potentially overvalued

#### For Bull Market:

- **Acceptable PEG:** Up to **2.0**
- Markets are generally more expensive
- Investors pay premium for growth

### Interpretation

| PEG Ratio | Interpretation                   |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| < 1.0     | Undervalued (Good buy)           |
| 1.0 - 1.5 | Fairly valued (Reasonable)       |
| 1.5 - 2.0 | Acceptable in bull markets       |
| > 2.0     | Potentially overvalued (Caution) |

## Cyclical Industries

### What are Cyclical Industries?

Cyclical industries are businesses whose performance is closely tied to economic cycles. They thrive during economic expansions and struggle during recessions.

### Examples of Cyclical Industries:

- **Steel**
- **Cement**
- **Automobiles**
- **Real Estate**
- **Manufacturing**

### Special Rule for Cyclical Businesses

**🚨 IMPORTANT: Buy Cyclical Stocks on HIGH P/E**

This is **OPPOSITE** to normal investing rules!

### Why Buy on High P/E?

#### During Economic Downturn:

- Profits are LOW
- EPS is LOW
- Share price relatively stable or fallen
- **P/E becomes HIGH** (Price / Low EPS)
- ✅ **This is the BUYING opportunity**

#### During Economic Boom:

- Profits are HIGH
- EPS is HIGH
- Share price elevated
- **P/E becomes LOW** (Price / High EPS)
- ❌ **This is when you should SELL**

### Manufacturing Cost Impact

Cyclical industries are heavily affected by:

- Raw material costs
- Demand cycles
- Economic conditions
- Interest rates
- Infrastructure spending

### Example: Steel Industry

**Recession Phase:**

- Low demand → Low prices → Low profits
- P/E might be 30+ (Buy opportunity)

**Growth Phase:**

- High demand → High prices → High profits
- P/E might be 8-10 (Sell opportunity)
