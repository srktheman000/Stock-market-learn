## **1. Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E Ratio)**

### **Definition**

The Debt-to-Equity Ratio measures how much a company depends on **debt** versus **equity** to finance its operations.

### **Formula**

```
Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity
```

### **Components**

- **Debt**:

  - Corporate Bonds
  - Bank Loans
  - Corporate Fixed Deposits (FDS)

- **Equity**:
  Owners' capital + retained earnings.

### **How to Use**

- Compare with other companies **in the same industry** (benchmarks vary by sector).
- Helps judge whether a company is taking **too much or too little financial risk**.

### **General Rule of Thumb**

- A healthy D/E ratio is typically **0.5 to 0.7** (industry dependent).

## **2. What Are Corporate Bonds?**

### **Definition**

A **corporate bond** is a debt instrument issued by a company (or sometimes government bodies) to borrow money from the public or institutions.
In return, they promise:

- A **fixed interest** every year (called coupon)
- **Repayment of principal** at the end of tenure (maturity)

### **Example Scenario**

#### **Government Infrastructure Bond Example**

- Purpose: Build infrastructure
- Amount needed: **₹1,000**
- Tenure: **5 years**
- Issued: **10 bonds of ₹100 each**
- Interest: **7% annually for 5 years**
- At maturity: Government returns **₹100** per bond.

#### **Cash Flow Summary per Bond**

- Every year: ₹7 interest
- Year 5 end: ₹7 interest + ₹100 principal returned

### **Credit Rating Agencies**

Ratings show how safe the bonds are:

- **Moody’s**
- **Fitch**
- **CRISIL**

Higher rating = safer bond, lower risk.

## **3. ROE — Return on Equity**

### **Definition**

ROE measures how effectively a company uses shareholder equity to generate profits.

### **Formula**

```
ROE = (Net Profit / Equity) × 100
```

### **Benchmark**

A good ROE is usually **15% or higher**.

### **Interpretation**

- High ROE → Company uses its equity efficiently.
- Low ROE → Company is not generating enough return compared to the money shareholders invested.
