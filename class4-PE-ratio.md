# 📊 Stock Valuation — Understanding EPS & P/E Ratio

Investing in the stock market requires understanding how to **value a company**.  
Two of the most fundamental concepts are **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** and the **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**.  
Let’s understand these concepts step-by-step like a tutor would explain in class.

## 🧩 1. Earnings Per Share (EPS)

### 💡 What is EPS?

**EPS (Earnings Per Share)** tells us how much profit the company earns **per share**.  
It helps investors understand how profitable the company is for each share they own.

### 🧮 Formula:

```

EPS = Net Profit / Total Number of Shares

```

### 🧠 Example:

Suppose a company has:

- Total profit = ₹500
- Total shares = 50

Then:

```

EPS = 500 / 50 = ₹10

```

✅ This means every share earns **₹10**.

### 📈 Why is EPS important?

- Higher EPS → More profit per share → Generally indicates a stronger company.
- Lower EPS → Less profit per share → May indicate weaker earnings.

## ⚖️ 2. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

### 💡 What is the P/E Ratio?

The **P/E Ratio** compares a company’s **current share price** to its **EPS**.
It tells us **how much investors are willing to pay** for ₹1 of a company’s earnings.

### 🧮 Formula:

```

P/E Ratio = Share Price / EPS

```

### 🧠 Example:

Suppose:

- Share Price = ₹350
- EPS = ₹10

Then:

```

P/E Ratio = 350 / 10 = 35

```

✅ This means investors are willing to pay **₹35 for every ₹1** of company profit.

## 🔄 3. How P/E Ratio Changes

| Scenario      | What Happens                 | Effect on P/E |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| Share Price ↑ | Company’s market value rises | P/E ↑         |
| Share Price ↓ | Market value falls           | P/E ↓         |
| EPS ↑         | Profits increase             | P/E ↓         |
| EPS ↓         | Profits fall                 | P/E ↑         |

### 💬 Example:

If EPS increases from ₹10 to ₹20 while price stays ₹350:

```

New P/E = 350 / 20 = 17.5

```

👉 P/E falls — meaning the stock becomes **more affordable**.

## 💰 4. Interpreting the P/E Ratio

| P/E Ratio    | Meaning                            | Comment                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| High P/E     | Investors expect future growth     | Stock may be **expensive**                 |
| Low P/E      | Market has low growth expectations | Stock may be **affordable or undervalued** |
| Very Low P/E | Could be undervalued — or risky    | Investigate company fundamentals           |

📘 **General rule of thumb:**
A **P/E ratio around 25** is often considered **reasonable** for a stable, growing company.

## 🎯 5. Summary

| Term | Formula                | Indicates                  | Ideal Situation                   |
| ---- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| EPS  | Profit / No. of Shares | Profit per share           | Higher EPS = better profitability |
| P/E  | Share Price / EPS      | How expensive the stock is | Around 25 = healthy valuation     |

---

### 🧠 Final Thought

> A high P/E ratio isn’t always bad — it may indicate strong growth potential.
> A low P/E ratio isn’t always good — it may signal slow growth or poor performance.
> Always compare **P/E within the same industry** to get meaningful insights.

**👨‍🏫 Tutor Tip:**
Don’t invest based only on EPS or P/E. Combine these with other metrics like:

- **ROE (Return on Equity)**
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**
- **Revenue Growth**

These help you understand the **complete picture** of a company’s financial health.
