# 📈 Initial Public Offering (IPO) – Explained

## 🧾 What is an IPO?

An **Initial Public Offering (IPO)** is the process by which a **private company** offers its shares to **public investors** for the first time. By doing so, the company becomes “publicly listed,” enabling anyone to buy or sell shares of the company on stock exchanges like NSE or BSE.

### 👀 Why Do Companies Go for IPO?

- **Raise Capital**: To fund expansion, R&D, pay debts, or enter new markets.
- **Increase Visibility**: IPO brings attention from investors, media, and analysts.
- **Liquidity for Promoters & Early Investors**: They can monetize their holdings.
- **Valuation Discovery**: Public trading helps establish the company's market valuation.

## 📦 Types of IPO Components

When a company launches its IPO, the total issue size is usually split into two types:

### 1. 🆕 Fresh Issue

This involves **new shares being created** and offered to the public.

- **Purpose**: To raise fresh capital for business use.
- **Effect**:

  - Increases the **number of outstanding shares**
  - Dilutes the ownership of existing shareholders

- **Money Flow**: Goes directly to the company.

**Example**:
If a company issues 1 crore new shares at ₹100 each, it raises ₹100 crore, which it can use for expansion, infrastructure, etc.

---

### 2. 🔁 Offer for Sale (OFS)

In this component, **existing shareholders (promoters or private investors)** sell their shares to the public.

- **Purpose**: Gives early investors or promoters an exit opportunity.
- **Effect**:

  - No change in total outstanding shares
  - No dilution of ownership

- **Money Flow**: Goes to selling shareholders, **not** the company.

**Example**:
If a promoter sells 50 lakh shares at ₹100 each, he/she receives ₹50 crore. The company does not receive any funds.
