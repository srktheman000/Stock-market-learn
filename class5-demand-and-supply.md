# 📈 Demand and Supply – Lecture Notes

---

## 🧠 Basic Concept

**Demand and Supply** are the two fundamental forces that determine the price of an asset (e.g., stocks, commodities, etc.) in the market.

- **Demand** is the quantity of a product or asset that buyers are willing to purchase at different price levels.
- **Supply** is the quantity that sellers are willing to offer at different price levels.

## 🚗 Example: TATA Motors (Passenger Vehicle Division)

### How can their stock price go up?

These factors increase profit → which increases demand for the stock:

- 🔼 Higher vehicle **sales**
- 🧾 Lower **taxes** or **tax benefits**
- 🛠️ Big **orders** from government or companies

## 💹 What is Spread?

**Spread** is the difference between the Buy price (Bid) and Sell price (Ask) of an asset.

- Smaller spread → More liquidity & active trading
- Larger spread → Less liquidity & uncertainty

## 📈 How "Pump" Works in Demand

This is the role of **incremental demand**:

| Buy Price | Sell Price | Quantity Sold |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| 500       | 510        | 5             |
| 510       | 520        | 5             |
| 520       | 530        | 5             |
| ...       | ...        | ...           |
| 600       | 600        | 90            |

➡️ If demand keeps coming in higher, the price will keep rising.

## 📉 Supply Side: Why Stock Can Fall?

Factors that increase **supply** (i.e., selling pressure):

1. 🧾 **Extra Taxes** imposed on the company.
2. 🔥 **Fire/Blasts** or adverse events impacting production.
3. 📉 Declining **sales** numbers.

## 🛵 Example: OLA Stocks – Price Movement

| Buyer Price | Seller Price |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 90          | 100          |
| 80          | 90           |
| 70          | 80           |
| ...         | ...          |
| 60          | 60           |

➡️ When supply overwhelms demand, prices fall to the last deal point (here ₹60 with 900 stocks traded).
