# Lesson_ROE_Stock_Split_and_Debt_to_Equity.md

## 📘 Lesson Overview

In today’s session, we explored **three important financial metrics** that every investor should understand when evaluating a company:

1. **Return on Equity (ROE)**
2. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**
3. **Stock Split and Dividends**

These concepts help investors determine how efficiently a company uses its capital, manages debt, and rewards shareholders.

## 🧮 1. Return on Equity (ROE)

### 🔹 Definition

**ROE (Return on Equity)** measures how efficiently a company uses shareholders' equity to generate profit.  
It shows how much profit a company makes for every ₹1 of shareholder investment.

### 🧩 Formula:

\[
\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Shareholder’s Equity}} \times 100
\]

### 🧾 Example:

- **Profit:** ₹15,000
- **Equity:** ₹50,000

\[
\text{ROE} = \frac{15,000}{50,000} \times 100 = 30\%
\]

✅ **Interpretation:**  
A 30% ROE means the company generates ₹0.30 profit for every ₹1 of shareholder investment.

### 💡 Key Insight:

- **ROE > 15%** → Generally considered a **good business**.
- Compare ROE to **risk-free returns** like **Fixed Deposit (FD)**, which offers around **7%**.
  - If ROE > FD rate → Business is outperforming a safe investment.

## ⚖️ 2. Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E)

### 🔹 Definition

The **Debt-to-Equity Ratio** measures how much debt a company uses to finance its assets relative to shareholders’ equity.

### 🧩 Formula:

\[
\text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shareholder’s Equity}}
\]

### 🧾 Example:

- **Debt:** ₹50,000
- **Equity:** ₹50,000

\[
\text{D/E} = \frac{50,000}{50,000} = 1
\]

✅ **Interpretation:**

- D/E = 1 → The company’s debt equals its equity.
- **Higher D/E ratio = higher risk**, because the company is more dependent on borrowed money.

### ⚠️ Ideal Range:

\[
0.5 < \text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} < 0.7
\]

This range indicates **a healthy balance** between debt and equity.

## 💹 3. Stock Split

### 🔹 Definition

A **stock split** occurs when a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares to make them more affordable without changing total market capitalization.

### 🧩 Example:

- 1 share of ₹1,000 → Split 1:5
  - Becomes 5 shares of ₹200 each.
  - Total value = ₹1,000 (unchanged).

✅ Purpose:

- Improves **liquidity** (more shares available for trading)
- Makes shares **affordable** for retail investors.

## 💰 4. Dividend

### 🔹 Definition

A **dividend** is the portion of a company’s profit paid to shareholders as a reward for their investment.

### 🧩 Example:

If a company announces a 15% dividend on a face value of ₹10:
\[
\text{Dividend per share} = 10 \times \frac{15}{100} = ₹1.5
\]

✅ **Key Takeaway:**  
Dividends reflect **profit-sharing** and **financial stability** of a company.
