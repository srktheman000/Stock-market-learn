# 📘 Stock Market Basics (Explained with Tea Shop Example)

## 🫖 Example Business: Tea Shop

Let’s imagine we start a small **Tea Shop** business.

### 💰 Initial Setup

| Item     | Amount (₹) |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Deposit  | 30,000     |
| Utensils | 20,000     |

**Total Initial Investment:** ₹50,000

This ₹50,000 is our **Equity** (the money owners put into the business).

---

## 🔹 Key Concepts Explained

### 1. **Equity**

- **Definition:** Money invested by owners in the business.
- **In our Tea Shop:** ₹50,000 equity = owner’s money invested to start the shop.
- In the stock market, _equity_ means ownership in a company.

---

### 2. **Revenue**

- **Definition:** Total income from selling products or services.
- **Example:**  
  ₹10 per cup × 100 cups = ₹1,000 revenue per day.

---

### 3. **Expenses**

- **Definition:** Costs to run the business (milk, tea, sugar, rent, etc.).
- **Example:**  
  ₹500 per day.

---

### 4. **Profit**

- **Definition:** What remains after expenses.  
  **Formula:** Profit = Revenue - Expenses  
  **Example:** ₹1,000 - ₹500 = ₹500 per day.

👉 **Monthly Profit:** ₹500 × 30 = ₹15,000

---

### 5. **IPO (Initial Public Offering)**

- **Definition:** When a company offers its shares to the public for the first time to raise money.
- **Example (Tea Shop):**  
  You decide to raise ₹50,000 from the public.
  - Total shares = ₹50,000 ÷ ₹10 = **5,000 shares**
  - Each share has a **Face Value** of ₹10.

This ₹50,000 is still **Equity**, but now shared among public investors.

---

### 6. **Face Value**

- **Definition:** The **nominal value** of a share decided by the company.
- **Example:**  
  Each Tea Shop share = ₹10 (Face Value).

Face value doesn’t change — it’s like the printed value on a currency note.

---

### 7. **Market Value / Market Price**

- **Definition:** The **current trading price** of the share in the market.
- **Example:**  
  If people like your Tea Shop business and demand increases,  
  share price may rise to ₹25 in the market.

---

### 8. **Market Capitalization (Market Cap)**

- **Definition:** The **total market value** of all shares.  
  **Formula:** Market Cap = Current Share Price × Total Shares  
  **Example:**  
  ₹25 × 5,000 shares = ₹1,25,000 Market Cap.

This shows what the market thinks your Tea Shop is worth.

---

### 9. **Dividend**

- **Definition:** Share of profit given to shareholders.
- **Example:**  
  If you decide to distribute ₹10,000 from your profit to shareholders:  
  ₹10,000 ÷ 5,000 shares = ₹2 per share dividend.

---

### 10. **Return on Investment (ROI)**

- **Definition:** Percentage of profit compared to investment.  
  **Formula:** ROI = (Profit / Investment) × 100  
  **Example:** ₹15,000 ÷ ₹50,000 = 30% annual ROI.
