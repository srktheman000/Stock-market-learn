# 📌 **Short Selling Explained (Based on Attached Images)**

### 🔴 What is Short Selling?

Short selling (also called _shorting_ or _selling short_) is a trading strategy where you **sell first and buy later**, expecting the price to fall.

👉 **You profit when the price goes down.**

---

### 📉 Example From Your Image

| Action         | Price |
| -------------- | ----- |
| **Sell first** | ₹100  |
| **Buy later**  | ₹80   |

**Difference = ₹20 profit per share**
If quantity = 100 shares

👉 **Profit = 100 × 20 = ₹2,000**

✔ You did NOT own the shares initially
✔ You borrowed them from the broker, sold them, and bought back cheaper later

---

### 🔄 Buy vs Sell (Short)

| BUY (Normal Trading) | SELL/SHORT (Reverse Trading) |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Buy at ₹100          | Sell at ₹100                 |
| Sell at ₹120         | Buy at ₹80                   |
| Price ↑ → Profit     | Price ↓ → Profit             |
| Profit = ₹2,000      | Profit = ₹2,000              |

⚠ **BUY = Profit when price goes UP**
⚠ **SHORT = Profit when price goes DOWN**

---

### ⏰ **Time Limit (From Image)**

- Normal intraday trading must be squared off **before 3:30 PM**
- If you **short-sell**, you must **buy back on the same day** (unless using F&O)

---

### 📈 Unlimited Loss, Limited Profit

From your notes:

- **Max profit = limited (price can’t fall below 0)**
- **Max loss = unlimited (price can rise infinitely)**

Example:

You short at ₹1,000
Price rises to ₹3,000 → You lose ₹2,000 per share ❌

That’s why short selling is **riskier than buying**.

---

### 🧾 F&O SELLING (From Image)

- In Futures & Options, you **can short-sell without buying first**
- You may **hold your short position until expiry** (monthly)
- No need to square off same day
